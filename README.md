# Telegram bot Template

This template has helped me in many of my personal and work projects, so I decided to share it so you can use it with me, maintain it, suggest changes and more. For fast and multiplatform development the bot has been packaged in docker.

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your .env file
